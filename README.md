# boattracker

I bought some chinese GPS tracker, installed it in my boat and got it to report positions to my server.  Now I'm doing stats on it, like pushing alarms to my cellphone if it's moved or if it the anchor drags while it's by anchor.

## Work in progress

My intention is to refactor and document everything in such a way that it can be used by other people than me.  I may even prioritize it if you nag on me.

## Web interface

The web interface is developed by my son
